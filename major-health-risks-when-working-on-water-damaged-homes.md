# Major Health Risks When Working on Water-Damaged Homes?

### Structural Problems

If the building has been pushed o its foundation, DO NOT enter it yourself. Only trained construction professionals should work in these dangerous conditions.  
• If you plan to enter a house that has been under water for a long time or has remained

wet, be sure that the oor has not rotted through. Test for rotten areas by hitting the oorboards with the end of a 2” x 4” piece of lumber.

### Mold

#### What are the health effects associated with exposure to mold?

People most often are exposed to mold by breathing in mold spores that oat in the air. ese mold spores are too small to be seen with the naked eye. When people with mold allergies breathe air that has high mold levels, they can have allergy symptoms such as stu y nose, sinus problems and shortness of breath. Even worse, they may have a life- threatening asthma attack.

#### What are the symptoms?

Get medical attention if you have the following symptoms: • Breathing di culties or shortness of breath  
• Wheezing  
• Sore throat

• Flu-like aches and pains  
• Fatigue \(tired for a long time\)

### Lead Dust

Many homes built before 1978 have paint that contains lead. As the building dries and paint akes and peels from the walls, lead dust can be a danger to people who do the clean-up. Demolition and renovation can make large amounts of dust that people in the home or workers can breathe in or get on their clothes, hands or food. By the time a person shows symptoms, the lead poisoning has already happened.

#### What are the symptoms?

Lead poisoning often shows no symptoms at all. Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in adults may include:  
• Pain, numbness or tingling of the hands and feet  
• High blood pressure

• Muscle weakness • Headache  
• Abdominal pain • Memory loss

• Sexual difficulties in men  
• Problems during pregnancy

### Carbon Monoxide

Carbon monoxide \(CO\) is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death. Burning fuels, such as gas, oil, kerosene, wood or charcoal, produce CO. No fuel burning equipment, including portable generators, should be used inside ood damaged homes.

### Cuts and Punctures

Broken glass, boards, exposed nails and other hazards are common in ood and storm damaged homes. Floodwaters may contain germs or viruses that can enter the skin through cuts and scrapes.

* Wear protective equipment to prevent serious injuries. Take special care to protect hands and feet.
* Check that you and your workers have current tetanus shots \(within the last 10 years\) before working in ooded areas.
* If a cut or puncture occurs, wash the cut immediately and treat with an antiseptic ointment such as Betadine or Povidine Iodine Cream.

### Electric Shocks

Electric shocks can kill. There is a danger of electrical shock from any electrical device that has been flooded. Rubber boots and gloves do not always protect from electric shock.

Turn off the electricity at the breaker before starting work if you do not know the condition of the wiring behind walls
