# Detailed Explanation on dealing with Snakes after flood

Many homes have been reported as being warm homes for snakes. Do not assume the absence of snakes if water has entered your house.

## Assessing the Danger:

1. **Resist the urge to attack the snake with a broom or stick. A snake won't attack you unless it feels threatened by you.** All snakes, venomous or otherwise, will not pursue a human being unless provoked.[1] Know that you are a larger predator and that the snake will keep to itself if you don't bother it.

* If you see that the snake has coiled itself up and opened its mouth wide, then you know that it sees you as a threat. Step away slowly to avoid any further risk.

2. **Determine whether or not it is venomous. While your first impulse might be to scream and run away, it's helpful to get a good look at the snake and quickly determine how major the risk is.** There are methods to discover if a snake is venomous.[2]Some major qualities of venomous snakes are fat bodies, large fangs, and slit-like eyes. You'll also want to keep your eyes out for the iconic rattling tail.

3. **Clear animals or young children from the area.** Regardless of whether or not the snake is a present risk, you'll want to make sure to reduce any and all potential dangers.Because of their size, your pets and children are at larger risk than a fully-grown adult. Their motion is also far more unpredictable, especially with your pets, and they are more likely to agitate the snake. Calmly move them away from the danger so that you can safely deal with the snake.


* If you suspect that your pet has been bitten, bring them to your local veterinarian. There may be some redness, swelling, or bruising on your animal. If so, you should act quickly, as they may be at risk of further harm or death.


## Removing the Snake


1. **Create a safe distance between you and the snake.** Even if you have the smallest suspicion that you have a venomous snake on your property, you must avoid entering its proximity. You might not want to leave the snake completely alone, as it could travel to another place in your home, but you should not attempt to get close to it. If the snake is mobile, however, and you worry that your presence might provoke it, evacuate the area and call an expert.


2. **Open the door and guide the snake out with a broom.** Only take this risk if you're certain the snake is not venomous. You shouldn't try to push the snake with the broom. Simply open the door and attempt guide it out softly. Because the snake's presence in your home is most likely completely accidental, it might be trying to get out itself.


3. **Restrict the snake's motion.** A heavy blanket or laundry hamper is best for this. If the snake is agitated, it will calm down soon after being covered. When it can't see you or its surroundings, the snake will feel less at risk.
Placing heavy objects around the edge of the blanket will prevent the snake from slipping out from underneath it and moving elsewhere. This will buy you some time to deal with it accordingly.


4. **Transport the snake outside.** If you're still not positive that the snake isn't venomous, do not, under any circumstance, attempt to move it. Be sure to wear some sort of hand protection, either gloves or oven mitts, before handling a snake. Approach the snake slowly, being careful not to scare it. [6]
The best way to hold a snake is directly under its belly, near the tail. Inch your hand underneath its body, keeping a solid, but not overly firm grip. You don't want to injure the snake by squeezing too hard. Let it slither in your hands a bit, as this will make it feel more comfortable. Walk it away from your property and release it safely into nature.
If you've trapped the snake under a blanket or other cloth material, you can scoop it up and transport it outside that way. Still be cautious about holding it too tightly, especially as you can't see its movement.


5. **Call and ask an expert to collect the snake.** This is the best solution, after you've restricted the snake, if you don't want to handle it yourself. They will safely catch and release it far from your property.


6. **Leave the snake alone.** If you cannot see the snake, but know that it is hiding in a dresser or other dark enclosed space, you should not attempt to catch it. Move all family members away from the immediate area. Because you can't see the snake, you have no idea if it's venomous. It may also currently be in a state of agitation.
If you come across a snake outside your property, you should also leave it alone. If the snake is not venomous, then it is of no real risk to you. It should find its way out of the yard on its own terms, and it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about its presence. If the snake is venomous, then you can quickly evacuate the area and get further removal help.
Never attempt to kill a snake. Most illegitimate bites happen when people try to kill a venomous snake.
