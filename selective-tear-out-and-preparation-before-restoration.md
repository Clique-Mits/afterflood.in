# SELECTIVE TEAR OUT AND PREPARATION  BEFORE RESTORATION

**Clean up as you go** 

Every piece of moldy material you clean out can re- contaminate the work you have done. As you work, remove large objects from the building and place smaller objects in heavy-duty trash bags. 

**Open attic**

 Ventilate the attic if you plan to save a plaster or dry- ceiling in a closet.

**Open crawl space**

 Crawl spaces must be open to air in order to dry out the house. At a minimum, create openings at available, set up a fan to blow air out of the opening running in the crawl space until it is dry. Because this space may be contaminated, wear maximum protec- tion whenever you have to enter it.

**Drywall**

  Drywall that has been underwater must be removed. If or mold damage is high, remove all of the drywall to the ceiling. 

 If there has been limited drywall may be removed to the 4 foot line. Drywall is sold in 4 foot sections. NO MOLD must be visible above the 4 foot line on both the inside and outside of the wall for this option to be safe. 

**Plaster walls** 

If plaster is sound on the walls facing the outside and there is no insulation in the wall, try to save the plaster walls. To dry out wall cavities, remove the baseboard, then remove plaster to just below the top of the baseboard. 

**Insulation** 

Dispose of insulation in heavy-duty trash bags. 

**Kitchen cabinets and countertops**

 Kitchen cabinets made of pressboard or other com- posite boards that have gotten wet cannot be saved. Cabinets, especially top cabinets, made of plywood or wooden boards may be saved. You can save the counter top and kitchen sink with work and plumbing when you replace the base cabinets. 

**Kitchen and bathroom Fixtures** 

Use a disinfectant to kill any remaining mold and other contaminants on hard surfaces that will remain in the home. Damp wipe all

**Ceramic Flooring** 

Ceramic flooring laid directly onto cement/concrete slabs may require only HEPA vacuuming, and then washing with a disinfecting solution. Remove and dispose of ceramic flooring placed on plywood or presswood subflooring that is damaged. 

**Wood windows, doors and trim** 

Wet scrape all wood to be saved or scrub it with a wet abrasive sponge to remove loose paint. Assume all paint on pre-1978 house trim has lead in it. Scrub the surface with a wet cleaning solution. 

**REPAIRING BUCKLED TONGUE AND GROVE FLOOR** 

For minor buckling cut a saw kerf through the center of one board. This will create an 8th inch space that will allow the board to be screwed flat. If there is major buckling remove one floor- board in the center of the warped area. Forcethe boards on both sides tight to each other. Face- screw the boards down. Scribe the board you removed and cut off the excess on the tongue side. Face screw this board down. You’ll probably need to drill pilot holes for the finish head screws or the heads will strip.
